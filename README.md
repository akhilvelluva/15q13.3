# 15q13.3 Project
We analyzed the effects of the 15q13.3 microdeletion on genome-wide gene expression using native RNA-seq data from blood of 3 individuals with the 15q13.3 microdeletion and 4 sex- and age-matched control subjects. We assessed differentially expressed genes (DEGs), gene ontology (GO) enrichment, protein-protein interaction (PPI) functional modules, as well as gene expression in different brain developmental stages.
## Data Analysis Methods
### RNA mapping
We have used the Human genome version 38 for mapping the Illumina NovaSeq paired-end reads with STAR aligner version 2.6.1.
